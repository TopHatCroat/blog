The third week picked up the pace a bit, the challenge was balancing it with
other things in my life, as I've recently also picked up running. There were a
few things I found myself doing that made it easier though.

### Knowing what will be the first thing for tomorrow

This has worked nicely for me in the past as well, and it's where I will
deliberately leave something unfinished, so that I know what I will be working
on
the next day. This has the added benefit of making it easier to start doing it
as you can just get straight into it.

### Even the smallest things count

Back in my [Week 1](https://martinovic.blog/posts/week-1-consistent-coding/) I
mentioned that "There is no minimum size for the commit, simple documentation
changes are just fine", and this has been a great hack for me, actually. I've
found that even the smallest changes, like fixing a typo, or adding a comment,
or even just a commit message, can be enough to get me into the flow of things,
and then I can continue working on something else.

### Having a list of things to do

Well this one is obvious, JIRA wouldn't be such an expensive piece of software
if having lists of things wasn't a good productivity boost, but even for small
private projects, I've found that having a prioritised list of things to do is a
good way to keep myself on track and not get distracted by other things.

## A lot of time spent on reading

This week I was also spending quite a bit of time investigating ChatGPT and
other AI tools, there are a lot of legitimate usecases and I feel like we have
only just started to comprehend what we can do with them, but for my self, just
to start off, [Open AI docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) have
been a pretty nice read. They've also recently unveiled
their [Code interpreter](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#code-interpreter)
feature, which I'm looking forward to trying out. I've also been reading [Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecasting:_The_Art_and_Science_of_Prediction) by	Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner, which has been a pretty interesting read so far, it has heavy [The Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series) vibes.
