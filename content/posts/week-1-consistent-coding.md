# The problem

Ever since my role changed from a software engineer to a engineering manager,
I've been coding far less, my contributions were mostly in the form of code
reviews and the occasional bug fix, and this has fueled a feeling of longing to
actually write code again, to be able to create something from scratch. I've
been thinking about this for a while. I've decided to try and do something about
it.

# The solution

I've decided to try and do at least 1 commit every day, this is a small
experiment to see if I can get back into the habit of coding, and to see if I
can actually do it every day and to keep myself a bit more accountable, I'll be
posting weekly updates on my blog here. This comes from the personal learnings
of the last few years that I have spent reading through various books. One of
the most influential ones
was [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear, which
I highly recommend, it's a book that has a lot of actionable advice on how to
build habits and how to break bad ones.

This brings me to this little personal experiment and a few of the rules I've
set for myself:

1. At least 1 commit every day
2. There is no minimum size for the commit, simple documentation changes are
   just fine
3. The commit can be in any project, personal or open source (here's hopping I
   can get myself involved more in open source)

# So what did I do this week?

It has mainly been about some demo projects utilising various new web
application development technologies, well not new per se, but certainly new to
me. These
were [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
and [Fly.io](https://fly.io). Some CMSs like [Strapi](https://strapi.io/)
and [Payload](https://payloadcms.com/), which might or might not feed into
another project in the future. I've also been investigating a new auth
system [Zitadel](https://zitadel.com) which is showing a lot of promise for a
small new startup. And I've also updated the Hugo
theme [izi](https://github.com/TopHatCroat/izi-hugo-theme/) used by this blog by
doing some RSS bug fixes.

That's it for this week, it's not much but it's honest work. Looking forward to
giving a week 2 update.
