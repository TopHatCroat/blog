The second week started of slow with some very small commits, it was about
fixing up the Zitadel demo I started, which, to be honest, was only broken
because I didn't read the documentation properly. Ahh yes, the famous dilemma,
should I spend 3 hours with try different random things or should I spend 30
minutes reading the docs? I think we all know the answer to that one. RTFM, but
hey, at least I got to learn a bit more about the Zitadel API.

Next up were some tiny changes to RSS feed on this bug, there was some Mastodon
about whether to keep the full content of the post in the feed or just the
summary, it ended up being that most people want the full thing, so I've added
that in.

The last thing I worked on was on the [Payload](https://payloadcms.com/) demo,
I've added a few collections and generated fixture or database see to make
development easier, and I've started adding some actually frontend to it, again,
based on [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), good old web development.
