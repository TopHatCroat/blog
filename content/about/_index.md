I have 7 years of professional experience in IT industry ranging from a software engineer to an engineering manager
role. I have a constant will to learn new skills and technologies in application development and leadership, but I also
spend a fair chunk of my time scouring Wikipedia and watching YouTube explainers videos. In my free time I also
love to (in alphabetical order) bike, hike, listen to music, philosophize, play video games and read books.

## Skills

Lately I've been working as a engineering manager, which gave me a great chance to do mentoring and coaching while
leading teams on a microservice transformation which includes discussing with all stakeholders, planning and
coordination and occasionally beating colleagues in Rocket League.
Previously, I've been a software engineer in variety of areas like backend development with Kotlin and Spring Boot,
frontend development React and React Native and also Android, DevOps with Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD and
Crossplane which taught me to appreciate the advantages of CI/CD and GitOps.
During my work I have used PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Elasticsearch and I have a very good understanding of GNU/Linux.

Besides the technical skills I'm confident in my human skills as well, as I've had the chance to work in very diverse
and capable teams and been able to communicate through the requirements and problems with my colleagues and the
clients in English and Croatian.
