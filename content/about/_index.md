I have been programming and developing applications for over 12 years now, with 7 years of
professional experience. I have a constant will to learn new skills and technologies in the field
of application development, leadership, computer networks and security. In my free time I love
to exercise, hike, build and fly FPV racing drones, listen to music and philosophize.

### Skills
Lately I've been working as a engineering manager, which gave me a great chance to do
mentoring, coaching and leadership and I use this knowledge to constantly improve reev's
development process as well as working on microservice transformation which includes
discussing with all stakeholders, from devs to business. 
Previously, I've been a full stack engineer focusing on Kotlin backend development with 
Spring Boot, for the web and mobile clients I've worked with React and  React Native
technologies. I've also been developing my DevOps
skills with Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD and Crossplane which taught me to
appreciate the advantages of CI/CD and GitOps.
I've also acquired more than 6 years of Android development and Express with NodeJS
using different software architectures such as MVP and MVVM, leveraging functional paradigms 
with the help of reactive libraries. 
During my work I have learned how to use different dialects of SQL (mostly PostgreSQL) and
I have also used NoSQL database systems such as MongoDB and Elastisearch.
I have a very good understanding of GNU/Linux and I use it as my daily driver.

Besides the technical skills I'm confident in my human skills as well, as I've have had
the chance to work in very diverse and capable teams and been able to communicate through
the requirements and problems with my colleagues and the clients in English and Croatian.
